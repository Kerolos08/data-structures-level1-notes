# What is ADT?

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)

- ADT stands for Abstract Data Type. It is a mathematical model of a data type, where the behavior
and properties of the data type are defined, but not its implementation.
- ADT is a set of objects together with asset of operations.
- In other words, an ADT defines what a data type can do, but not how it does it.
- An ADT specifies a set of operations that can be performed on the data type, and defines the
behavior of those operations.
- Examples: Vectors, Stack, Queue, …etc
