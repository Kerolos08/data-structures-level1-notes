### **Program Speed = Hardware + Algorithm**

When building a program, two main factors affect its performance:

**1. Hardware (Performance)**

The specifications of the machine running the program (CPU, RAM, etc.).

Higher specs generally lead to faster execution.

However, developers usually assume reasonable hardware and focus on algorithm efficiency instead.

**2. Algorithm (Complexity)**

This includes:

- **Time Complexity**:
    
    How execution time grows with input size (lower is better).
    
- **Space Complexity**:
    
    How much memory the program requires (lower is better).
    

Writing efficient algorithms with low time and space complexity is a top priority for developers, as algorithm improvements benefit performance regardless of hardware.
