# Big O(n) : Linear Time Function

# Notes

## Big O(n) — Linear Time Complexity

**Big O(n)** represents a **linear time algorithm**, meaning the execution time **grows proportionally with the input size (`n`)**.

---

## Key Concept

> In O(n) algorithms, the number of operations increases linearly as the input size increases.
> 
- Input size = 10 → ~10 operations
- Input size = 100 → ~100 operations
- Input size = 1,000 → ~1,000 operations

---

## Why It Is Called Linear Time

- The algorithm **loops once over the input**
- Each element is processed **one time**
- Runtime depends directly on `n`

---

## Common O(n) Operations

- Iterating through an array or list
- Linear search
- Copying data
- Finding max or min
- Printing elements

---

## Summary

- O(n) is efficient for **small and medium inputs**
- Much better than O(n²)
- Slower than O(1) and O(log n)
