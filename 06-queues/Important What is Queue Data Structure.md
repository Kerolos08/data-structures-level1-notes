# Important: What is Queue Data Structure?

A **queue** is a **linear data structure** that stores elements in an ordered way and follows the principle:

## **FIFO — First In, First Out**

This means the **first element added** to the queue is the **first one removed**.

## Queue (Data Structure)

- Stores **multiple elements** of the **same type**
- Elements are added at the **rear (back)**
- Elements are removed from the **front**
- Order of elements is preserved
- Can be implemented using **arrays** or **linked lists**

---

## Basic Queue Operations

- **Push: Enqueue** add an element to the rear
- **Pop: Dequeue** remove an element from the front
- **Front / Peek**: view the front element without removing it
- **Is Empty**: check if the queue is empty
- **Is Full**: check if the queue is full (array-based)

## Example

**line at a cashier**:

- The first person who comes is the first to be served
- New people join at the end of the line

## Common Types of Queues

- **Simple Queue**
- **Circular Queue**
- **Priority Queue**
- **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**
