# What are the Classification/Types of Data Structures?

## **Classification/Types of Data Structures**

### Primitive & Non-Primitive

**Primitive**

Basic data types, 

It is generally a basic structure that is usually
built into the language, such as an integer, a
float

- Integer
- Float
- Char
- Pointer

**Non-Primitive**

Advanced (complex) data types, 

It is built out of primitive data structures linked
together in meaningful ways, such as arrays,
linked-list, binary search tree, Tree, graph etc

- Linear List
    - Array
    - Linked list
    - Stack
    - Queue
- Non-Linear List
    - Graph
    - Tree

### Linear & Non-Linear

**Linear**

Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.

- Array
- Linked list
- Stack
- Queue

**Non-Linear**

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.

In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only.

- Graph
- Tree

### Homogeneous & Non-Homogeneous

**Homogeneous**

All elements are of the **same data type**.

- Array of int
- Array of float

**Non-Homogeneous**

Elements can be of **different data types**.

- Structure
- Class

### Static & Dynamic

**Static**

static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the
elements in a static data structure.

- Array

**Non-Static**

In dynamic data structure, the size is not

fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient
concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.

- Stack
- Queue
