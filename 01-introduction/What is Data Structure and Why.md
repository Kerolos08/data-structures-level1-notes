- You know Algorithms is a step by step procedure to solve a particular problem.
- To Develop a program with an algorithm, we should select an appropriate data structure for it.

### Data Structure

- Is a way of organizing all data items and their relationships to each others inside the program in order to deal with them.
- Affects the design of both structural and functional aspects of the program.
- Is how u organize, manage and store data for efficiency reasons
- It is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
- There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used
in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we
must have good knowledge of data structures.
- Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement
of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing,
processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all.
- Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features,
applications, advantages, and disadvantages.
